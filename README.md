# Milktea-Machine-Python

Simple milktea machine system made using Python with OOP principles

Description

Let's write a class that represents a milktea machine. The class should have methodthat takes strings as an input. Every time the user inputs a string to console, the program invokes this method with one argument: the line that user inout the console. This system simulates pretty accurately how real-world electrnic devices work. External components (like buttons on the coffee machine or tapping on the screen) generate events that pass into the single interface of the program.
